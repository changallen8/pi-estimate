# pi-estimate
Using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of pi. Includes a plot and graph for visualization of the simulation.

Uses math and random to generate plot points between (-1,-1) and (1,1). Then uses matplotlib to plot the points and visualize the "circle".
Pi is then calculated using a ratio of points in the circle to points outside the circle.

This is an example of what a finished plot may look like:
